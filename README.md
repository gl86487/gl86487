## What is global warming?
Global warming is the heating of Earth's climate system over a long period of time. Global warming is also referred to as climate change. Recently, climate changes have been
very observable. Climate change is mostly caused by humans from fossil fuel burning or farming. Greenhouse gases are caught in Earth's atmosphere, 
radiate in all directions, and are unable to escape, thus warming the Earth. The rising climate harms humans and wildlife as 
glaciers are melting and sea levels are rising. There will be an increase in droughts and heat waves. The consequences casued by society's unrepairable actions
will continue to worsen in the near future. 

### Climate change causes
Greenhouse gases include:
- Water vapor
- Nitrous oxide
- Methane
- Carbon dioxide

## How can I prevent climate change?
It would be very challenging to completely end climate change as it has already done a great amount of damage to Earth. A single person cannot 
prevent this dilemma themselves but you can still take action.

- [ ] Save energy at home; use solar panels, LED lighting, clean energy
